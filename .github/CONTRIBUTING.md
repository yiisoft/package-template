# Getting started

Since Yii 3 consists of many packages, we have a [special development tool](https://github.com/yiisoft/docs/blob/master/005-development-tool.md).

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-dev-tool).

2. [Set up your own fork](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-dev-tool#using-your-own-fork).

3. Now you are ready. Fork any package listed in `packages.php` and do `./yii-dev install username/package`.

If you don't have any particular package in mind to start with:

- [Check roadmap](https://github.com/yiisoft/docs/blob/master/003-roadmap.md).
- Check package issues at github. Usually there are some.
- Ask @samdark.

## Reporting a Security Issue
