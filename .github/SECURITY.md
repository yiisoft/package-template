# Security Policy

If you have encountered a security-related issue with Yii, please use the [security issue form](https://www.yiiframework.com/security) to report any security issues you have encountered to us.

> ***WARNING!*** DO NOT use the issue tracker or discuss it in the public forum as it will cause more damage than help.

> Please note that as a non-commercial OpenSource project we are not able to pay bounties at the moment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability.
Once confirmed, the Yii team will take the following actions:

- Acknowledge to the reporter that weâ€™ve received the issue, and are
  working on a fix. We ask that the reporter keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
- Get a fix/patch prepared.
- Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
- Release new versions of all affected versions.
- Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement
