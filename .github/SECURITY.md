## Reporting a Vulnerability

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability.
Once confirmed, the Yii team will take the following actions:

- Acknowledge to the reporter that we’ve received the issue, and are
  working on a fix. We ask that the reporter keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
- Get a fix/patch prepared.
- Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
- Release new versions of all affected versions.
- Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement
